organisms with eyes can see other organisms from up to 10 m away

energy used = size + (speed**2/4)

spectrum of diet (soft to tough foods) affects how well each organism can eat that type of food

organisms can eat or attempt to eat food that is within 3 m of them

organisms can develop genetic fears or predatory instincts towards other creatures by comparing the similarity of a creature's genetic id to a saved one

genetic id format is as follows:
<3 digit hue value>||<soft-tough edible spectrum>||<soft-tough flesh spectrum>||<size>||

hsv: 0-359
rgb: 0-255

fears/prey stored as follows:
self.fears = [[dna,intensity], [dna,intensity]]

intensity ranges from 0-10
